## What's the point of developing things if you can't show them off to the world?

Jokes aside, the purpose of this website is to showcase my side projects.

The site is hosted on GitHub pages, and uses Jekyll to generate the HTML content, which has been styled with mostly vanilla CSS.

In all honesty, there isn't anything too intriguing about the construction of this site. It utilises CSS Flexbox and Grid for the layouts of each webpage.

One of my favourite aspects of this site is the list of utilised technologies shown at the top of this page and other those of other projects. Without Jekyll, hard-coding these would have been extremely clunky, but it's front matter allows for it to be implemented simply and extended and maintained quite easily too.

That's all I have to say as of now. Hopefully by the time you're reading this, this site has been populated with many more interesting projects.

Feel free to check out this project's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/avidargan/avidargan.github.io).
